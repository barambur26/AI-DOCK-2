## üêõ Troubleshooting

If departments still show as hardcoded:
1. Check browser developer tools for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify the department service API is accessible
3. Check network tab to see if department API calls are being made
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

If UI appears broken:
1. Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. Check for any CSS conflicts
3. Verify all component dependencies are properly imported

## üéØ Expected Results

1. **Dynamic Departments**: The department dropdown should now show departments that were actually created in the system, not the hardcoded list.

2. **Modern UI**: The quota management page should have a sleek, modern appearance with:
   - Glassmorphism effects
   - Smooth animations
   - Better spacing and typography
   - Responsive design
   - Interactive hover states

3. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features should continue to work exactly as before, just with better visual design and dynamic data.
