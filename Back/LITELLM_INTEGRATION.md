# üöÄ AI Dock - LiteLLM Cost Calculation Integration

## Overview

This update fixes the cost calculation and reporting system in AI Dock by properly integrating LiteLLM for exact cost calculations. Previously, the actual cost was always showing as `None` because calculated costs were incorrectly stored as `estimated_cost` instead of `actual_cost`.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Core Issue
- **Problem**: Calculated costs were stored as `estimated_cost` instead of `actual_cost`
- **Result**: Usage logs showed `actual_cost: None` despite having accurate cost calculations
- **User Impact**: No visibility into actual LLM usage costs, making budget tracking impossible

### Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed Usage Logging**: Updated all usage logging methods to store LiteLLM calculated costs as `actual_cost`
2. **Enhanced Cost Calculation**: Added config-based estimated costs for comparison with actual LiteLLM costs
3. **Improved Logging**: Enhanced log messages to show both estimated and actual costs
4. **Added Admin Tools**: Created new endpoints for managing and updating pricing data

## üìä Cost Calculation Flow

### Before (Broken)
```
LiteLLM calculates cost ‚Üí stored as estimated_cost
actual_cost = None
```

### After (Fixed)
```
LiteLLM calculates cost ‚Üí stored as actual_cost ‚úÖ
Config pricing ‚Üí stored as estimated_cost (for comparison)
```

## üÜï New Features

### 1. Enhanced Cost Logging
- **Actual Cost**: Real-time cost from LiteLLM pricing data
- **Estimated Cost**: Config-based cost for comparison
- **Cost Source Tracking**: Know whether costs came from LiteLLM or fallback pricing

### 2. Admin Pricing Management API
New endpoints under `/admin/pricing/`:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/admin/pricing/refresh/{config_id}` | POST | Update pricing for specific config |
| `/admin/pricing/refresh-all` | POST | Update pricing for all configs |
| `/admin/pricing/preview/{config_id}` | GET | Preview pricing changes |
| `/admin/pricing/cache-stats` | GET | View cache statistics |
| `/admin/pricing/clear-cache` | POST | Clear pricing cache |

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when LiteLLM is unavailable
- Detailed error logging for pricing issues
- Cache management for optimal performance

## üß™ Testing

### Run the Integration Test
```bash
cd /Users/blas/Desktop/INRE/INRE-DOCK-2/Back

```

This test verifies:
- ‚úÖ LiteLLM installation and availability
- ‚úÖ Pricing service functionality
- ‚úÖ Cost calculator integration
- ‚úÖ Model name mapping
- ‚úÖ Real vs. estimated cost comparison

### Expected Test Output

## üìà Usage Monitoring

### New Log Format
Before:
```
Usage logged successfully: user=admin@aidock.dev, provider=Anthropic (Claude), model=claude-3-sonnet-20240229, tokens=291, cost=$0.0206, success=True
```

After:
```
‚úÖ Usage logged successfully: user=admin@aidock.dev, provider=Anthropic (Claude), model=claude-3-sonnet-20240229, tokens=291, actual_cost=$0.0206, estimated_cost=$0.0206, success=True
```

### Database Changes
- `actual_cost`: Now properly populated with LiteLLM calculated costs
- `estimated_cost`: Config-based estimate for comparison
- Both fields use USD currency

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Existing Installations

1. **No Database Migration Required**: The changes are in application logic only
2. **Restart Backend**: Simply restart your AI Dock backend to apply changes
3. **Update Pricing** (Optional): Use the new admin endpoints to refresh pricing data

### For New Installations

Everything works out of the box with accurate cost tracking from day one.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### LiteLLM Integration
- **Automatic**: LiteLLM integration is enabled automatically if the package is installed
- **Fallback**: If LiteLLM is unavailable, falls back to config-based pricing
- **Caching**: Pricing data is cached for 6 hours to reduce API calls

### Model Mapping
The system automatically maps AI Dock model names to LiteLLM format:

| Provider | AI Dock Model | LiteLLM Model |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Anthropic | claude-opus-4-0 | claude-3-opus-20240229 |
| Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4-0 | claude-3-sonnet-20240229 |
| OpenAI | gpt-4 | gpt-4 |
| OpenAI | gpt-3.5-turbo | gpt-3.5-turbo |

## üìä Admin Dashboard Integration

### Usage Analytics
- View actual costs vs. estimated costs
- Track cost accuracy over time
- Identify pricing discrepancies

### Pricing Management
- Update all configurations with latest pricing
- Preview pricing changes before applying
- Monitor pricing cache performance

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. LiteLLM Not Available
**Symptoms**: Logs show "LiteLLM not available - using fallback pricing"
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install litellm==1.73.6
```

#### 2. Model Not Found in LiteLLM
**Symptoms**: Warning logs about model not found in cost map
**Solution**: Check model name mapping or use the preview endpoint to verify

#### 3. Cache Issues
**Symptoms**: Stale pricing data
**Solution**: Use `/admin/pricing/clear-cache` endpoint

### Log Analysis
Look for these log patterns:
- `‚úÖ Updated pricing from LiteLLM` - Successful LiteLLM integration
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to fetch LiteLLM pricing` - Fallback to config pricing
- `üîß Config pricing missing/zero` - Pricing update needed

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Pricing Alerts**: Notify when pricing changes significantly
2. **Cost Forecasting**: Predict monthly costs based on usage patterns
3. **Budget Enforcement**: Automatically pause services when budgets exceeded
4. **Multi-currency Support**: Support for different currencies beyond USD

## üìö Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `usage_service.py`: Fixed cost field assignments
- `streaming_handler.py`: Enhanced cost calculation comments
- `pricing_update.py`: New admin API endpoints
- `main.py`: Added pricing router registration

### Dependencies
- `litellm==1.73.6`: Already installed in requirements.txt
- No additional dependencies required

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Pricing is cached for 6 hours
- **Non-blocking**: Cost calculation happens in background
- **Resilient**: Graceful fallback if external services unavailable

## üéØ Success Criteria

After implementing this fix, you should see:

1. **‚úÖ Populated actual_cost fields** in usage logs and database
2. **‚úÖ Accurate cost tracking** matching LiteLLM pricing
3. **‚úÖ Both estimated and actual costs** for comparison
4. **‚úÖ Admin pricing management** capabilities
5. **‚úÖ Improved cost visibility** in analytics

---

**üéâ Result**: AI Dock now provides accurate, real-time cost tracking with full LiteLLM integration, giving you complete visibility into your LLM usage costs and budget management capabilities.
