AI Dock Chat API Endpoints - Modular Version

This is the new modular version of the chat API that replaces the massive 2,038-line monolithic file.
The functionality has been split into smaller, maintainable modules for better organization.

Original file: chat_original_backup.py (2,038 lines, 88KB)
New structure: /api/chat/ modular directory with focused responsibilities

🏗️ Modular Architecture:
=======================
- /api/chat/main.py - Core chat functionality with assistant integration
- /api/chat/configurations.py - LLM configuration management
- /api/chat/models.py - Model discovery and management  
- /api/chat/health.py - Service health monitoring

📦 Supporting Services:
======================
- /services/chat/file_service.py - File attachment processing
- /services/chat/assistant_service.py - Assistant integration logic
- /services/chat/model_service.py - Model processing and filtering

📋 Extracted Schemas:
====================
- /schemas/chat_api/requests.py - Request validation schemas
- /schemas/chat_api/responses.py - Response formatting schemas
- /schemas/chat_api/models.py - Model-specific schemas

✅ All original functionality preserved:
- Chat streaming with file attachments ✅
- Assistant integration ✅ 
- Model validation and switching ✅
- Cost estimation ✅
- Configuration testing ✅
- Dynamic model fetching ✅
- Unified models endpoint ✅
- Usage logging ✅
- Conversation management ✅
- Error handling ✅

🎯 Benefits of Modular Structure:
================================
- Single Responsibility: Each module has one clear purpose
- Better Testability: Isolated functions can be unit tested
- Improved Maintainability: Changes isolated to specific modules
- Easier Debugging: Smaller files are easier to navigate
- Code Reusability: Services can be reused by other endpoints
- Clear Dependencies: Import relationships are explicit

# Import the modular chat router from the chat package
from .chat import router

# Export the router for use in main.py
__all__ = ["router"]

# The router is now fully modular and maintains all original functionality
# while being split into logical, maintainable components.
