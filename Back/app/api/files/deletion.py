    Delete a file (soft delete by default).
    
    ðŸŽ“ LEARNING: Soft vs Hard Delete
    ===============================
    Two deletion strategies:
    
    **Soft Delete** (default):
    - Mark file as deleted in database
    - Keep file on disk for recovery
    - User can't see it anymore
    - Can be restored by admin
    
    **Hard Delete** (permanent=true):
    - Remove file from disk completely
    - Delete database record
    - Cannot be recovered
    - Use only when certain
    
    Most applications use soft delete by default for safety!

    ðŸŽ“ LEARNING: Bulk Operations
    ===========================
    Bulk operations improve user experience:
    - Select multiple files and delete all
    - More efficient than individual requests
    - Better error handling (partial success)
    - Atomic operations when possible
    
    This endpoint processes each file individually and
    reports success/failure for each one.
