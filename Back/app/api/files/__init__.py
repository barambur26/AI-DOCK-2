File API Router - Main entry point for all file operations.

This module combines all file-related API endpoints from modular components:
- Upload operations (upload, validation)
- Retrieval operations (download, metadata)
- Listing operations (list, search)
- Deletion operations (delete, bulk delete)
- Statistics operations (stats, limits, health)
- Utility operations (preview)

ðŸŽ“ LEARNING: Modular API Organization
===================================
Large API modules can be broken down into focused sub-modules:
1. Each module handles one specific area of functionality
2. Main router combines all sub-routers
3. Dependencies are shared across modules
4. Easier to maintain and test individual components

This follows the single responsibility principle and makes
the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
