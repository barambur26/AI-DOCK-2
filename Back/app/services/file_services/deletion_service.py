File Deletion Service for AI Dock

Atomic service responsible for file deletion operations:
- Soft delete (mark as deleted, recoverable)
- Hard delete (permanent removal)
- Bulk deletion operations
- Permission validation
- Deletion tracking and auditing

ðŸŽ“ LEARNING: Deletion Strategy Patterns
======================================
This service implements multiple deletion strategies:
- Soft delete: Safe, recoverable, audit-friendly
- Hard delete: Permanent, space-saving, irreversible
- Bulk operations: Efficient multi-file processing
- Permission-based: Only authorized users can delete
- Follows integration guide's data management patterns
